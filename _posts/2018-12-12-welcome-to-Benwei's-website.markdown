I made my first academic website today, the last day of my first semester as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah. Doing this website is an assignment of *Intro to Computing PhD*, instructed by [Dr. Tucker Hermans](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/). I found that it is great, and I will continually update it during my academic life.
